## ABOUT ME
I like building things that sit between the physical world and the digital one. Most of my work lives somewhere around XR, sensors, and perception. I enjoy figuring out how raw signals turn into meaningful interaction.
I tend to learn by experimenting. Sometimes that means building a full project, sometimes i's just a small demo to understand one concept better.
Long term, I'm interested in perception-driven systems in XR or robotics, especially where hardware and software have to work closely together!
