## PROJECTS
### [CODE BLOCKS - Educational Programming System](https://github.com/Mitsuki-Nakajima/CODE-BLOCKS)
CODE BLOCKS is a hands-on programming tool designed to teach basic Python logic using physical 3D-printed blocks instead of typed code. Each block represented a programming structure (loops, conditionals, etc.). Users could arrange the blocks physically, and a Unity application interpreted the configuration and visualized how the program would execute.

### [KENDOSENSE - Motion & Grip Analysis for Kendo (Active Project)](https://github.com/Mitsuki-Nakajima/KENDOSENSE)
Kendo Sense started as a question: 
> Can we measure technique in a sport that is usually judged only by feel?

The idea is to attach small sensors (IMUs) to the shinai or body to capture motion data during strikes. By analyzing acceleration and rotation patterns, the system could potentially evaluate aspects like fumikomi timing or tenouchi (grip technique).


## TECH DEMOS
### [Tag-based AR (ArUco Tag)](https://github.com/Mitsuki-Nakajima/Tag-based-AR/tree/main)
A small tech demo that detects ArUco markers from a webcam feed and estimates each tag’s pose (position + rotation).  


## ABOUT ME
I like building things that sit between the physical world and the digital one. Most of my work lives somewhere around XR, sensors, and perception. I enjoy figuring out how raw signals turn into meaningful interaction.
I tend to learn by experimenting. Sometimes that means building a full project, sometimes i's just a small demo to understand one concept better.
Long term, I'm interested in perception-driven systems in XR or robotics, especially where hardware and software have to work closely together!
