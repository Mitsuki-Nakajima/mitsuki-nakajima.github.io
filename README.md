## PROJECTS
### [CODE BLOCKS - Educational Programming System](https://github.com/Mitsuki-Nakajima/CODE-BLOCKS)
**Description:** CODE BLOCKS is a hands-on programming tool designed to teach basic Python logic using physical 3D-printed blocks instead of typed code. Each block represented a programming structure (loops, conditionals, etc.). Users could arrange the blocks physically, and a Unity application interpreted the configuration and visualized how the program would execute.

**What I worked on:** Built the Unity application in C#, designed the logic system that translated block configurations into executable behavior, and helped structure how abstract programming concepts map to physical interaction

**Learning Outcome:**
- How to connect physical interfaces with digital systems
- How to represent abstract logic in a structured way
- How important clarity and feedback are in educational tools

### [KENDOSENSE - Motion & Grip Analysis for Kendo (Active Project)](https://github.com/Mitsuki-Nakajima/KENDOSENSE)
Kendo Sense started as a question: 
> Can we measure technique in a sport that is usually judged only by feel?

The idea is to attach small sensors (IMUs) to the shinai or body to capture motion data during strikes. By analyzing acceleration and rotation patterns, the system could potentially evaluate aspects like fumikomi timing or tenouchi (grip technique).

**Takeaways so far:**
- Researching IMU placement for meaningful motion capture  
- Studying how rotational and linear acceleration data reflect strike mechanics  
- Prototyping concepts for wearable sensor integration  

**Why it’s interesting**
Kendo training relies heavily on qualitative feedback. I’m interested in whether quantitative sensing can support skill development without disrupting tradition.

**Learning Outcome:**
- Sensor data is noisy and context-dependent  
- Physical movement is more complex than it looks  
- Hardware constraints strongly shape system design

## ABOUT ME
I like building things that sit between the physical world and the digital one. Most of my work lives somewhere around XR, sensors, and perception. I enjoy figuring out how raw signals turn into meaningful interaction.
I tend to learn by experimenting. Sometimes that means building a full project, sometimes i's just a small demo to understand one concept better.
Long term, I'm interested in perception-driven systems in XR or robotics, especially where hardware and software have to work closely together!
